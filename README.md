## Installation

To install TizenBrew Installer, you'll need a PC or a mobile device and a USB Stick.

First, download the [latest userwidget.zip file](https://github.com/reisxd/TizenBrewInstaller/releases/latest) from releases. After downloading it, extract the zip file directly to your USB Stick and plug it in to your TV.

After plugging the USB Stick in, the TV should show a notification saying the app is being installed. 

After it's installed, you'll need to set Developer Mode Host PC IP to `127.0.0.1`.

You can follow [this](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/using-sdk/tv-device.html#Connecting-the-TV-and-SDK) guide for more information.

Note: If your TVs language is RTL (right to left), the IP must be `1.0.0.127`.

After setting the Developer Mode settings, you should be able to use TizenBrew Installer.
